       <h3>Not only is an omelette quick and easy to make, it is a paragon of economy. Odds and ends (a.k.a. leftovers) rise to a new level when placed inside an omelette.

        Leftover, cooked vegetables paired with a little cheese and folded into eggs present a much more cheerful meal than a bowl of vegetables haphazardly reheated in the microwave!

FRENCH VS AMERICAN OMELETTES: 
    </br>
</br>
It seems that the French invented omelettes, possibly stealing the idea from the Romans. Let’s leave the argument there and just say that the omelette has a long history.

A French omelette starts out with beaten eggs in the pan (just like scrambled eggs). The pan is shaken constantly during cooking until the eggs just begin to set. When the eggs are cooked, the omelette is rolled and snugly folded to form an oval and finally turned out onto a plate with the seam side down.

It can be plain or filled, with or without cheese. (An omelette with fines herbes is a famous standard French dish. An assortment of chopped herbs is stirred into the eggs before cooking; no cheese.)
</br>
</br>
An American omelette (or "omelet" as they are sometimes spelled) starts out in the same way, but as the eggs cook, the edges are lifted from the sides of the pan with a spatula so the runny eggs can flow underneath.

When the eggs are nearly set, the filling is added and the omelette is folded in half rather than rolled.

<h3>
1.Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.</br></br>
2.Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.</br></br>
3.Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.</br></br>
4.Fill the omelette: Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds</br></br>
5.Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.</br></br>
