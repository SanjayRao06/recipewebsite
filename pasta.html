       <h3>The term “Pasta” is uniquely Italian, but pasta probably didn’t originate in Italy. It likely came in the form of noodles from somewhere in Asia brought by traders many centuries ago. Some sources credit Marco Polo with bringing pasta back from China, but this is likely centuries too late as trade routes between Asia and Europe predated him. Now, what happened with those noodles once they got to Italy is another story. The many types of Italian pasta we know today are due largely to the ingenuity of the Italians.

Pasta is generally made with flour, eggs, and water though the egg is omitted in many pasta types, and other ingredients such as rice flour or legumes are occasionally used. The most common flour used is semolina, a coarse flour produced from durum wheat.

There are two ways to turn the dough into pasta:

The first way of making pasta is rolling and cutting. This is pretty self explanatory as the dough is rolled flat and cut.
The second way of making pasta is extruding. With extruding the soft dough is forced through a die that produces the desired shape.

<h3>
    step-1</br></br>
    Boil approx. 6 cups water in a large pot/pan over medium flame. Add raw pasta, 1 teaspoon oil and salt (approx. 1 teaspoon).</br>
step-2</br></br>
Stir well and let them boil until pastas are al dente (cooked but not very soft). It will take around 10-12 minutes. Stir in between occasionally to prevent sticking.</br>
step-3</br></br>
To check whether pasta are cooked or not, bite one pasta. If it is too hard to bite or is white in the center, it is raw and requires cooking little longer. If it is slightly firm to bite, then it means it is cooked to al dente. If you want your pasta to be very soft, cook them for 2-3 minutes more once they are al dente.</br>
step-4</br></br>
Drain the water by carefully transferring the cooked pasta to large strainer (or a colander).</br>
step-5</br></br>
    While pasta is cooking, you can make the red pasta sauce by following this red tomato pasta sauce recipe. Add sauce in a pan and heat it over medium flame.</br>
    step-6</br></br>
    Add cooked pasta and mix well. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Turn off the flame. Tomato Pasta is now ready. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese or feta cheese or grated mozzarella cheese.</br>
