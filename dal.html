HISTORY OF DAL: 
    </br>
</br>
The Indian dal has as many recipes as there are families in India. But there are two popular ones - an exotic and rich restaurant style known as tadka dal and then a basic simple dal recipe the way its prepared at home.

Tadka is an Indian word used to denote the process of seasoning a dish by gently tempering spices in hot oil and then adding it to the preparation. This helps extract the aromas and infuse it into the dish.

Recipe Ingredients</br></br>
Dal or Lentils: Here I am using masoor dal (red lentils) as it is widely available and cooks quickly into a smooth dish. But you can also use many other Indian yellow lentils - channa dal, toor dal, split moong dal, or a combination.</br>

Spices and Condiments: The tadka style requires cumin seeds, garlic, ginger, dried red chillies, curry leaves, turmeric, chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala, kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves), finely chopped shallots or onions etc</br>


Tomatoes: A small amount of finely chopped tomatoes adds a delightful taste, texture and appearance to the dal.</br>

Chopped Cilantro: This is an essential herb to use for dal.</br>

Curry leaves: This imparts a characteristic taste that is typical for dal and some Indian dishes. The fresh leaves are available at Indian grocery stores and dried leaves can be found online.</br>

Ghee/Butter: A dollop of ghee or brown butter drizzled over dal takes it to the next level.</br>

Green chillies: If you want the dal to be hot, add chopped green chilies.</br>


Lemon: If you like the dal to be a bit tangy you may add some lemon or lime juice.</br>
